Our work is open source, part of the hive gitlab core code, and is shipped across all nodes enabling devs, app builders, and users alike to make the best out of Hive. Not to limit our contribution to backend apps, we've also been working on front end apps part of core dev, such as block explorer and health checker, while also helping wherever needed. Our team of 6 developers is excited to continue our work in the upcoming year and has submitted a DHF proposal to make that happen. As always, your support is essential for us to move forward. More details are in the following DHF link. We would appreciate your vote in support. Thank you! https://peakd.com/proposals/360 "
