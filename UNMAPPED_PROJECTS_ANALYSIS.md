## Recommendations

1. **Review the Google Sheets document** (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19XYWrs9HnkCCWyyW7gLQy7HN0a9cY81_x4cSmwPwQCA/edit) to identify which verticals these projects belong to
2. **Update `lib/data/verticals.ts`** to include missing projects
3. **Fix name mismatches** (e.g., "Hive Fest" → "HiveFest")
4. **Consider grouping** similar projects (e.g., "Misc work", "Professional services", "Digital Marketing" might all be "Professional Work")
5. **Handle special cases** like "Refund" which appears to be loan payments

## Next Steps

To map these projects:
1. Review each unmatched project against the verticals document
2. Assign each to one of the four vertical categories:
   - Ecosystem Marketing
   - Social Impact + Niche Promotion
   - Hive and HBD Adoption
   - Conferences
3. Add missing projects to `lib/data/verticals.ts`
4. Re-run the analysis to verify all projects are mapped
